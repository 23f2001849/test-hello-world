# Hello World Page

## Overview
This is a simple single-page web app that displays 'Hello World' in a large, centered h1 tag with the id 'greeting'. It utilizes Bootstrap 5 for basic styling and responsive behavior.

## Setup
To set up this web app, you simply need to host the `index.html` file on any web server. No special server-side setup is required.

## Usage
Once the `index.html` file is hosted on a web server, you can open it in any web browser to see the 'Hello World' greeting. The greeting is responsive and will remain centered on the screen regardless of the screen size or device orientation.
